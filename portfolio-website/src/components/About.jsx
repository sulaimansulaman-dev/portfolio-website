      <p>
        I'm a final-year BSc IT student passionate about learning new things,
        solving problems, and fixing tech. I enjoy collaborating with others,
        working hard, and always meeting deadlines. In my free time, I watch
        tech videos, play video games, or take things apart and put them back
        together.
